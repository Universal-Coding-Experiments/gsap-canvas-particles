## 🚀 Key Features

- **Smooth GSAP Timelines**: Leverages GSAP's powerful engine for fluid, high-frame-rate particle animations.
- **Canvas Rendering**: Uses the HTML5 Canvas API for efficient drawing, capable of handling hundreds of particles with ease.
- **Interactive UI**: Pointer events allow users to **toggle Play/Pause** by clicking anywhere on the screen.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Dynamic scaling, rotation, and easing effects that create a cinematic feel.
- **Fully Responsive**: Intelligent window resize handling ensures the canvas always fills the viewport perfectly.
- **Customizable Assets**: Easily swap particle images to create entirely different visual themes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend & Animation
- **GSAP 3**: The industry standard for high-performance web animations. Used for timelines, staggering, and easing.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Low-level rendering for high-performance graphics.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: Clean, framework-free logic for particle state management.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Utilized for base structure and responsive utilities.

## 🌓 Animated Design Philosophy

This project isn't just a simple animation; it's an exploration of **Creative UI/UX**. By combining **staggered animations** with **sine-wave easing**, we achieve a motion path that feels organic and "alive." The background turns into a canvas of light and motion, responding to your every click.
